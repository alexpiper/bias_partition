# Analysis for Martoni, Piper, Rodoni and Blacket (In prep)

This repository contains the code required for reproducing the analyses presented in our manuscript:

** Coming Soon **

## Data

The input sequencing data are not included in the repository for size reasons, and are instead available from the SRA under accession: ** Coming Soon **

However RDS files holding intermediate data objects such as the OTU and taxonomy tables suitable for performing the analyses are contained within output/rds and these can be used to reproduce the statistical analyses.

## Analysis 

The bioinformatic workflow used to analyse the sequence data can be found in the bioinformatics.rmd file in the root directory or rendered: [Here](https://alexpiper.github.io/metabarcoding_bias_partition/bioinformatics.html)

The statistical analyses can be found in the statistics.rmd file in the root directory or rendered: [Here](https://alexpiper.github.io/metabarcoding_bias_partition/statistics.html)
